        "descriptionFromReview": "I agree so much with this review from 11 months ago. \"A city right out of a dystopian novel\" - that's what I was thinking on the way to the Airport after spending just a week in Bangkok.  A city right out of a dystopian novel - soulless and cynical. The air is polluted and no trees are in sight. Its inhabitants manipulative and cold-hearted - hidden behind fake smiles. A Disney Land for senile retirees. Everything is for sale and nothing has value. The streets are filled with rats - both human ones and animals. After spending time here, you understand why their king lives in Bavaria. A place that would make you feel deeply depressed if you stayed for too long. ",

English speaking is okay. I did really enjoy a balance of simple, risk-free living at low cost and acceptable quality of living. Many places only accept cash but plenty accept card. There's lots to do and it's fun exploring on a moped/motorbike. It feels as easy as Canggu with more modern appointments to get by as a westerner a bit easier.",

        "descriptionFromReview": "Bengaluru, January  4-9, and 13-13, 2020.  Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore.   Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.   My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .  Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.  I will return to Bengaluru in the future.",

        "descriptionFromReview": "Kathmandu has frequent power outages as of December 2019 even though everyone says otherwise, as does Pokhara.  The old outages are referring to the load shedding issue which were routine power outages for the majority of the day.  Now power outages are not routine and can last unknown amounts of time, even the main (and only) airport loses power often.  Buildings are unheated, water for showering is generally unheated or lukewarm, many houses get their water from urban aquifers which may be heavily polluted, as city water is yellow and oily.  Many roads in the city are dirt, and air quality is extremely poor, especially during the crop burning season.  Locals are friendly and helpful and many outside of tourist areas may have never met a foreigner before.  The locals and the mountains make the place special, everything else about it is quite bad, notably hygiene, food safety, traffic danger, and exposure to all sorts of environmental pollutants.  That said, I will be returning to visit the local friends made while there.",

It's a bit of an older vibe than Canggu, and there's certainly a big chunk of yogi's kicking around ‚Äî but I liked it much better than Canggu and found it less pretentious. Plus, you can drive down there in 45mins whenever you want some beach or party vibes.   As others mentioned, there's some great coworking spaces, cheap warungs, some really nice spots to stay cheaply if you go just outside of the mad touristy areas like Hanoman/Monkey Forest/Penestan.  You're definitely going to want a scooter, and you'll learn quickly which roads to avoid at what times because the traffic can be pretty crazy ‚Äî but that's true for Canggu as well.  It's green and lush, there's great food and a handful of good bars, lots of great pools and chillout spots, good yoga and gyms, and you're within 45mins ride of the beach, waterfalls, and jungles. Pretty damn good in my books.",

Things are affordable although I have noticed a tamer street food scene compared to other places in Vietnam like Hanoi. Seems to be making more room for higher end dining but affordability is still easy. HCMC without a doubt has some great nightlife, so party animals are going to be very happy here.

        "descriptionFromReview": "Semiyak was my refuge from the crazy traffic, massive western crowds, mosquito attacks, and inflated prices of Canggu. Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone.   Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho.   Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak  is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak.  If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western.  Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away.  If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak. Prices are better than Canggu but again, you need to dig a bit.",

        "descriptionFromReview": "The worst traffic in the world. The word traffic is misleading because it assumes movement, often during rush hour it can take 1.5 hours to go 10km (how do you like 3 hour daily commutes). The streets are chaotic like world war 3. If you get anxiety/claustrophobia this is not a place to be. Food is not great and unhealthy (lots of fried oily foods). And lots of garbage, litter, pollution just not a very pleasant place. It‚Äôs also hard to meet or really integrate with locals as a foreigner. The one redeeming factor is that Philippine people are so warm and hospitable. Without that it would be unbearable. ",

Davao City is only boring if you don't know where to go, and as someone who lives outside of Davao, I find myself coming back more than five times a year for the people, the culture it has, and how conveniently close it is to beautiful vacation places.

        "descriptionFromReview": "Seseh is a small, beachy area north of Canggu. It's not really a community of its own, although that's changing as people move north from being priced out of the Canggu Airbnb market.  Seseh is built mostly on \"green land\", or land zoned for nature use rather than commercial or residential use. For this reason, land is scarce and rentals are quite expensive, with some Airbnb properties exceeding $6000 USD/mo.   There is an enclave of expensive Airbnbs next to Seseh Beach which has nice homes. Good for a well-to-do family. Not worth it if you're single, as you will be quite isolated here and you'll need to drive ~25 minutes to get to Canggu proper.  WiFi speeds are slow and wifi coverage can be spotty. Don't recommend if you need low latency for your work.  Not a lot going on at night or during the day here. It's very quiet. Not a lot of shops, restaurants, or things to do other than the beach. You're a bit too far for Gojek delivery from Canggu restaurants.  4/10 for digital nomads 8/10 for families with kids who want a big property and beach access. ",
